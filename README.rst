spreadr
=======

The notion of spreading activation is a prevalent metaphor in the cognitive sciences.
This package provides the tools for cognitive scientists and psychologists to conduct computer simulations that implement spreading activation in a network representation.
The algorithmic method implemented in *spreadr* subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (2011, Frontiers), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could spread among nodes that were connected to each other via edges or connections (i.e., a network).
See Vitevitch, M. S., Ercal, G., & Adagarla, B. (2011).

Installation
############

You can install the stable version via ::

  > install.packages("spreadr")

or the latest version (on the GitHub master branch) ::

  > remotes::install_github("csqsiew/spreadr")
  > # alternatively
  > # devtools::install_github("csqsiew/spreadr")

If you encounter which looks like ::

  Error: (converted from warning) package 'Rcpp' was built under R version x.y.z

try setting ``Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")`` first [#]_.

Development Notes
#################

Install developer dependencies
******************************

There are some additional packages that need to be installed for the *spreadr* developer, e.g. those used in the unit tests.
To install these developer dependencies, use ::

  > devtools::install_dev_deps()

Testing with the semantic priming simulation
********************************************

By default, running the test suite will replicate most of the simulations in the article describing *spreadr* [#]_ except for the last, *"Simulation Study 3: Semantic priming"*.
That simulation requires 800 iterations each taking a few minutes, making it impractical for testing.

However, there is an option to include the replication of the first iteration of that simulation, with ``retention = 0.8``.
Simply set the environment variable ``TEST_SEMANTIC_PRIMING`` to any non-empty string.
For example, within an interactive R session: ::

   > Sys.setenv(TEST_SEMANTIC_PRIMING="true")
   > devtools::test()

Or, through ``R CMD``: ::

   $ cd ..
   $ R CMD build spreadr
   $ TEST_SEMANTIC_PRIMING=true R CMD check spreadr_x.y.z.tar.gz

replacing ``x.y.z`` with the version string.

Testing with animated GIFs
**************************

There are some snapshot tests checking for the generation the animated GIFs.
By default, these tests are not run.
This is because (i) we expect GIF generation to differ trivially with development environments (so that the tests fail, but not in meaningful ways), and (ii) the spreadr results underlying the GIF is always tested before the GIF generation.

However, the GIF generation snapshot tests are still available for use.
Simply set the environment variable ``TEST_ANIMATED_GIF`` to any non-empty string, just as with the semantic priming simulation tests.
These tests can be useful for you to visualise the spreadr results.

Invalid ELF header
******************

If you encounter an "invalid ELF header" error, as in ::

  > devtools::load_all()
  Loading spreadr
  Error in dyn.load(dllfile) :
    unable to load shared object '/home/ning/github/spreadr/src/spreadr.so':
    /home/ning/github/spreadr/src/spreadr.so: invalid ELF header

Try calling ``devtools::clean_dll`` first [#]_.
