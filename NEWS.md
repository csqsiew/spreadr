# updates of 10th May 2021

## bug fixes
- fixed (#1) issue related to missing activation values at leaf nodes 

## new features

- specify retention values for each node
- decide whether to allow spreadr to run for a fixed number of time steps or choose a threshold to stop the process (threshold_to_stop)

- merged spreadr and spreadr2 functions (fixed time and threshold to stop)
